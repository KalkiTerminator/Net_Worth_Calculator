{#
  signup.html — Account creation page.

  KEY CONCEPTS:
  - "extends base.html" inherits the nav bar and layout from base.html.
  - The form POSTs to /signup in main.py, which validates the input, hashes the
    password, and creates the user in the database.
  - "required" attribute means the browser won't submit unless the field is filled.
  - "minlength=6" is client-side validation (the server also checks this).
  - "name or ''" pre-fills the name field if the form was resubmitted due to
    an error (so the user doesn't have to type it again). The "or ''" part
    prevents "None" from showing if the variable doesn't exist.
  - type="password" hides the characters as the user types (shows dots instead).
  - type="email" makes the browser validate that it looks like an email address.
