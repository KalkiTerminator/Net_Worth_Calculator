{#
  login.html — Login page for existing users.

  KEY CONCEPTS:
  - Similar to signup.html but with fewer fields (just email + password).
  - The form POSTs to /login in main.py, which looks up the user by email
    and verifies the password using bcrypt.
  - If login fails, the Python route passes an "error" variable which gets
    displayed by base.html's flash message section.
  - "email or ''" preserves the email they typed so they don't have to
    re-enter it after a failed login attempt.
